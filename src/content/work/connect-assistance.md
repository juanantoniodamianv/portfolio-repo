##### My role at Connect Assistance
Backend and Frontend Developer

November 2020 to June 2023 · 2 yrs 8 mos
##### One of the last projects that I've been involved in Connect Assistance was EOS
EOS a b2b platform that presents assistance services to providers and insurers. One of the main features I developed on this platform was the ability to generate payment invoices for suppliers. In other words, providers with access can generate invoices for services that are pending payment. This streamlines the company's accounting process, as previously suppliers had to go to the company's office to submit their invoices.

The company have presence in five countries of America, each one with it's own specific business model. This means that I have developed certain characteristics that adapt to each business model, such as:
- A job for a worker to automatically generate invoices
- Calculation of taxes (each country has its own specific percentage)

Also I am proud to have designed and implemented the feature flag from scratch (I know there are several tools that can do this, but in discussion with my team we decided to develop it ourselves from scratch, in a more minimalistic and adapted way to our needs). It is based on components and pages, related to branch, user type, and role. This allows us to speed up the process of releasing new features to a certain type of user, and also quickly disable components or pages in case of error.

##### Responsibilities during my work
  - Transitioned multiple projects from JavaScript to TypeScript
    - Conducted analysis and created interfaces and types to facilitate the transition.
  - Configured Mezmo logs for backend applications.
  - Implemented unit testing for several processes that are core to the company system.
  - Developed feature flags from scratch, utilizing in React components and routes.
  - Created a reconciliation script to ensure consistency between PostgreSQL and MongoDB records in a legacy project.
  - Implemented collections of configuration records in a NoSQL database:
    - Messages: Configuration that establishes acceptance criteria for triggering messages (SMS, WhatsApp, or email) to clients.
    - Add-ons: Configuration that establishes acceptance criteria for creating service assistance add-ons.
  - Improved and added new features to a system utilized by suppliers, insurers, and accountants. Technologies used include Node.js, Prisma ORM (with Postgres), React, and AWS (S3, SQS).
  - Successfully implemented and configured several objects and workflows within Salesforce.
  - Observability: Implemented New Relic and Sentry dashboards to monitor and track errors in several systems
